Neste trabalho, propomos o Problema de Roteamento em Arcos com coleta de Prêmios
no contexto da Dengue (Dengue-PARP), que  é o problema de encontrar rotas ótimas
para  veículos nebulizadores  como  uma  medida de  controle  do crescimento  da
população de mosquitos. No Dengue-PARP, cada  arco de um quarteirão tem um valor
de prêmio relacionado ao número de casos  de Dengue. O objetivo do Dengue-PARP é
maximizar os prêmios coletados criando uma rota que que passe por um subconjunto
de  quarteirões. Este  trabalho formula  o Dengue-PARP  utilizando um  modelo de
Programação Inteira (PI), submetido a experimentos computacionais em um conjunto
de 39 instâncias do mundo real  com casos notificados confirmados. A metodologia
obteve soluções ótimas  em 31 instâncias, sendo  todas as 25 que  contém até 372
vértices e  6 das  maiores instâncias,  que contém até  1212 vértices.  O modelo
também obteve soluções viáveis para as 8 instâncias restantes.

\begin{abstract}

In  this  work, we  propose  the  Dengue  Prize-collecting Arc  Routing  Problem
(Dengue-PARP),  which is  the problem  of  finding optimal  routes for  spraying
vehicles as a control measure of the mosquito population growth. In Dengue-PARP,
each arc  of a street block  has a prize value  related to the number  of dengue
cases. The goal of  the Dengue-PARP is to maximize the  prize collected in order
to create  a route  that covers  a subset  of blocks.  This work  formulated the
Dengue-PARP as  an Integer  Programming (IP)  model, subjected  to computational
experiments with a set of 39 real-world instances with confirmed notified cases.
The methodology achieved optimal values for  31 instances, being all the 25 that
contains up to  372 vertices, and 6  of the largest instances,  containing up to
1212 vertices.  The model also obtained  feasible solutions for the  8 remaining
instances.

\section{Introduction}


According to the Pan American Health Organization  (PAHO), in the year of 2021 a
total  of  1.324.108  cases  of  arboviral diseases  were  reported.  Of  those,
1.173.674 ($89\%$) were Dengue cases, 131.630 were Chikungunya cases, and 18.844
were  Zika. Between  the \gls{ew}  1 and  the \gls{ew}  19 of  2022, a  total of
1.279.724 arboviral disease have already  been reported, in which Brazil appears
in first  position as  the country  with the largest  number of  Dengue reported
cases, achieving a total of 1.114.758 ($90.9\%$) \citep{paho-1}.

The  prevention,  control,  and  combat   of  diseases  caused  by  arboviruses,
especially dengue,  has been subjecting of  great concern worldwide, as  it is a
reemerging disease caused by the transmission of Den  1, Den 2, Den 3, and Den 4
viruses  through  the {\em  Aedes  aegypt}  and  {\em Aedes  albopictus},  which
proliferates in  the tropical  regions of  the world,  comprising more  than 1.8
billion of people susceptible to being infected \citep{negreiros-2020}.

The  control  of  the mosquito  can  be  done  in  two ways:  eliminating  adult
mosquitoes,  and  eliminating  the  larval  breeding  grounds.  In  addition  to
precaution,  where the  focus  is to  make the  population  aware and  eliminate
possible  recipients  that  could  serve as  breeding  grounds  for  mosquitoes,
chemical control is the most used approach. The chemical control consists in the
use of chemical  substances (for example insecticide) for vector  control in the
larval and adult stages.

The use of  insecticides in public health is based  on technical and operational
standards, derived  from a group  of experts in  pesticides of the  World Health
Organization (WHO), which recommends the  active ingredients of the products and
recommends the doses for the various types of available treatments. The rational
and  safe use  in  vector  control activities  is  essential,  given that  their
indiscriminate use determines  environmental impacts, in addition  to the vector
developing resistance to the products. An emergency approach to reduce the adult
mosquito  population, used  in case  of epidemics  or endemics  mainly in  urban
areas, is to  apply insecticide using nebulizer equipment  attached to vehicles,
which   we   call   throughout   this  work   spraying   vehicle,   see   Figure
\ref{fig:nebulizer}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{fumace.jpg}
    \caption{Nebulizer equipment attached to vehicle \citep{fumace-2022}.}
    \label{fig:nebulizer}
\end{figure}

Spraying vehicles are useful for the  control of outbreaks and epidemics, due to
its high performance, 80 to 160 blocks per day depending on the equipment model.
These  applications must  be constantly  supervised to  guarantee the  indicated
insecticide  dosage  in  each  visited  street,  since  there  is  a  series  of
operational   factors,  such   as   the  equipment   flow   and  vehicle   speed
\citep{brasil-dept-helth:2009}. To have the desired effect, the spraying must be
realized in a  period with correct conditions to maintain  the insecticide cloud
staying close to the ground. The  thermal inversion is generally produced in the
morning, after the sunrise, and in  the afternoon, just before sunset and, these
moments  are considered  optimal  to  apply the  insecticide  with the  spraying
vehicle.

The sprayed insecticide has no residual  effect and it is strongly influenced by
wind  and obstacles  along the  streets. The  best effect  is achieved  when the
densest  insecticide cloud  is at  a distance  of at  most 100  meters from  the
equipment.  As this  distance  is  crossed, the  effectiveness  decreases, as  a
consequence of droplet drift influenced by factors of the environment. The cloud
dispersion is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:dispersion}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{cloud-dispersion.png}
  \caption{Cloud dispersion of the application \citep{brasil-dept-helth:2009}.}
  \label{fig:dispersion}
\end{figure}

The instructions  about the insecticide  application are generally based  on the
ideal  conditions of  topology, the  structure  of the  locality, and  favorable
winds. The  operation is  often harmed  by unpaved roads,  the presence  of high
walls,  and  high   vegetation,  in  addition  to   headwinds.  The  application
methodology  must consider  these limitations  to obtain  a good  impact on  the
vector population. The vehicle must travel around each block before starting the
next one, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:travel-pattern}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

  \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{visit-pattern.jpg}
  \caption{Vehicle pattern with nebulizer \cite{brasil-dept-helth:2009}.}
  \label{fig:travel-pattern}
\end{figure}

The complexity of the process of prevention and control of the disease is large,
involving  only  in  Brazil,  annual   expenses  exceeding  R$\$$  1.6  billions
\citep{negreiros-2020}. Such resources  could be better allocated  if the dengue
logistics were better assisted by the tools of operations research.

To the  best of our  knowledge, we are the  first to introduce  the \gls{dparp},
which  is the  problem  of finding  optimal routes  for  spraying vehicles  with
resource constraints. \gls{parp}s are arc routing problems where, in addition to
the cost, there is a prize function that  must be taken into account when an arc
is serviced \citep{araoz:2006}.  In \gls{dparp}, each block has  a prize related
to how critical the  dengue outbreak is in that block measured  by the number of
Dengue  cases. Moreover,  the  routes must  satisfy  the block-visiting  pattern
described  in  Figure  \ref{fig:travel-pattern}   and  must  consider  time  and
insecticide  constraints. The  \gls{dparp} goal  is  to maximize  the prizes  by
setting a route  that covers the most critical streets/blocks.  In this work, we
formulated  the \gls{dparp}  as  an  \gls{ilp} model,  and  tested on  real-life
instances with confirmed notified cases.

This work is organized  as follows. In the next section, we  present a review of
the  literature on  machine learning  and operations  research tools  applied in
dengue logistics. Section \ref{sec:formulation}  introduces an \gls{ilp} for the
\gls{dparp}. Section  \ref{sec:instance-generation} explains how  instances were
obtained    and    organized    to    validate    the    methodology.    Section
\ref{sec:computational-results} reports  the computational results.  Finally, we
make our concluding remarks and discuss some perspectives for future work in the
last section.

\section{Related Work} \label{sec:related-work}

An extensive number  of works in the  literature use \gls{ml} in  the context of
dengue~\citep{shakurat:2015,shakil:2015,hair:2019,sarma:2020,appice:2020}.  Some
of  the main  problems addressed  are generated  Dengue diagnoses  based on  the
patient's symptoms and clinical patterns, distinguishing dengue and its types in
the early stage of disease progression  and, dengue fever predictions in certain
regions  based on  a  set of  factors, such  as  precipitation, rain,  humidity,
temperature, and others.

\cite{lowe:2015}  presented a  modeling procedure  to quantify  the benefits  of
including  climate  information in  a  dengue  model  for  the 76  provinces  of
Thailand, from  1982-2013. The authors considered  a set of factors  that have a
statistically  significant contribution  to  the relative  risk  of dengue.  The
system provided  an advanced warning  that enable  the implementation of  a more
effective surveillance system. According to  the authors, the proposed framework
was flexible to be applied in any geographical setting, generating a more global
approach to  assessing the impact of  climate variability and climate  change on
dengue risk.

\cite{bannwart-sbpo:2013,bannwart:2013}  proposed  numeric  techniques  using  a
genetic algorithm to solve the control model applied to Dengue prevention. Their
model  considered two  kinds  of  measures: the  cost  of  the chemical  control
(insecticide) and  genetic (releasing sterile  males in the  environment). These
works assume  that the mortality rate  of the mosquitoes is  strongly related to
the investment in  control approaches. The experiments considered a  time of 120
days and  the results  indicated that  the amount of  insecticide used  was high
considering the  other approaches cited  in the  work. The authors  presented an
analysis considering each control and its impact on the rate of reduction in the
mosquito population.

\cite{cantane:2015}  presented a  mathematical  model to  estimate  the rate  of
population growth  of mosquitoes. The  authors observed that, without  a control
action, the  population of mosquitoes  could rapidly increase in  short periods.
The  results of  the experiments  provide  estimates of  the life  cycle of  the
mosquitoes are in perfect condition in nature and the model allows to measure an
approximate number of mosquitoes for each scenario.

\cite{dosreis:2018},   \cite{florentino:2018},    and   \cite{florentino-b:2018}
presented methodologies  for dengue control, including  mathematical models that
describe the population dynamics of the  Aedes aegypti. A Genetic Algorithm (GA)
was developed  to obtain  optimal strategies using  an integration  of different
types  of control.  A Variable  Neighborhood Search  (VNS) determines  optimized
control strategies for the aquatic phase, which is when the mosquitoes are larva
and pupa.  The authors argue that  the control during the  aquatic phase reduces
the environmental  impact and the  use of chemical  control on large  scale. The
authors indicated that the presented methodologies  have the potential as a tool
for supporting decision-makers against arboviruses.

The works of \cite{negreiros:2008,negreiros:2011,negreiros-2020}, to the best of
our knowledge, are the only papers that apply operations research techniques for
solving routing problems  in the context of mosquito control.  These works focus
on the computational tool called Web Dengue, aimed at helping the Dengue control
managers  by  providing  a  better visualization  and  coordination  of  control
procedures.  Among  the  methodologies,   the  authors  developed  an  \gls{ilp}
formulation to  compute a periodical  scheduling of vehicles. A  GRASP heuristic
was also developed  to solve a real-life instance corresponding  to the location
of Praia de Iracema, Fortaleza.

\section{Mathematical Formulation for Dengue-PARP} \label{sec:formulation}

Consider a weighted, connected, and directed graph $G = (V, A)$, being $V = \{1,
\dots, n\}$ the  set of $n$ vertices, $A =  \{(i, j): i \text{ and }  j \in V, i
\neq j\}$ the set of $m$ arcs. A  block, in the \gls{dparp}, can be defined as a
cycle $C$ such that the arcs $(i, j)  \in C$ are in clockwise order. The set $B$
contains all blocks of the instance, and each vertex $i \in V$, that is not in a
dead-end street, belongs to at least one block, while each arc $(i, j) \in A$ is
in at most one block. The routes may start and end in any vertex of $G$, thus we
augment $G$ to $G' = (V', A')$  to include two artificial vertices, a source $s$
and a target $t$, and  a set of arcs such that $A' = A  \cup \{(s, u), (u, t)\},
\forall u \in V$. The notation $B(i)$ is the set of blocks in which $i$ belongs,
and $V(b)$ is the set of vertices in the block $b$.

We set the \gls{dparp}  entry as a tuple ($G', s, t, B,  \lambda, \xi, f^T, f^I,
i_{max}, T_{max}$).  Each arc contains  the values of dengue  cases ($\lambda$),
and distance ($\xi$). A  time function $f^T$ computes the time  to travel an arc
($f^T_{ij}$)  and the  time to  visit all  the arcs  of a  block ($f^T_b$).  The
function $f^I_b$  computes the amount of  insecticide used to spraying  a block.
Lastly,  consider  the available  amount  of  insecticide ($I_{max}$),  and  the
maximum time of the route ($T_{max}$).

In the proposed model, in order to spray a block it is sufficient that the route
contains at least one  vertex from the same block. This is  only possible due to
the block-visitation pattern (Figure \ref{fig:travel-pattern}), that states that
all the arcs of  a block must be sprayed before starting  another block. In this
case,  the traversed  distance, elapsed  time,  prize collected,  and amount  of
insecticide used to spray the block are consolidated by appropriate terms in the
objective  function and  constraints. This  is better  explained next,  where we
present an \gls{ilp} formulation for the \gls{dparp}.
\newline

\subsection{IP formulation}

Consider the following variables:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $x_{ij}$: A binary variable that indicates whether the arc $(i, j) \in
    A'$ belongs to the route;
  \item $y_{ib}$: A binary variable that is valued 1 if the vertex $i \in V$ is
    used as start point to spraying the block $b \in B(i)$; 
\end{itemize}
With these variables, the \gls{dparp} \gls{ilp} formulation reads:

\begin{align}
  \max & \sum_{i \in V} \sum_{b \in B} \lambda_b y_{ib} & \label{eq:of}\\
  \nonumber \text{subject to:} & & \\
       & \sum_{j \in V'\backslash \{t\}} x_{sj} = 1 & \label{eq:s-all} \\
       & \sum_{j \in V'\backslash \{s\}} x_{jt} = 1 & \label{eq:all-t} \\
       & \sum_{j: (i, j) \in A'} x_{ji} - \sum_{j: (i, j) \in A'} x_{ij} = 0 & \ \forall i \in V \label{eq:flow-conservation} \\
       & \sum_{(i, j) \in A'} f^T_{ij} x_{ij} + \sum_{i \in V} \sum_{b \in B} f^T_b y_{ib} \leq T_{\max} & \label{eq:max-time} \\
       & \sum_{i \in V'} \sum_{b \in B} f^I_b y_{ib} \leq I_{\max} & \label{eq:max-insecticide} \\
       & \sum_{i \in V(b)} y_{ib} \leq 1 & \ \forall b \in B \label{eq:max-attend} \\
       & \sum_{(i, j) \in A} x_{ij} \geq y_{ib} & \ \forall i \in V(b), b \in B \label{eq:in-path} \\
       & \sum_{(i, j) \in (S, \bar{S})} x_{ij} \geq y_{ib} & \ \forall S \subseteq V, i \in S, b \in B(i) \label{eq:subtour-elimination} \\
       & x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\} & \ \forall (i, j) \in A' \label{eq:dom-x} \\
       & y_{ib} \in \{0, 1\} & \ \forall i \in V, b \in B. \label{eq:dom-y} 
\end{align}

Each feasible solution for the \gls{ilp} model is a route starting at vertex $s$
and ending  in $t$  obeying the  limits of time  and insecticide.  The objective
function \eqref{eq:of} maximizes  the prize of each arc in  a block. Constraints
\eqref{eq:s-all}-\eqref{eq:flow-conservation} enforce flow  conservation at each
vertex. The  constraints \eqref{eq:max-time} limit  the time used by  the route,
considering  different velocities  for  when  the vehicle  is  spraying or  not.
Constraints  \eqref{eq:max-insecticide} limits  the amount  of insecticide.  The
constraints \eqref{eq:max-attend} and \eqref{eq:in-path} ensure that at most one
vertex   is   used  as   starting   point   to   spray  a   block.   Constraints
\eqref{eq:subtour-elimination} are subtour elimination constraints, ensuring the
connectivity of the route. Constraints \eqref{eq:dom-x}-\eqref{eq:dom-y} set the
domain of the variables. \newline

\section{Instance Generation} \label{sec:instance-generation}

The first  step in generating instances  for the \gls{dparp} is  the creation of
the street  network. This work  adopted the maps  available in the  project open
Street Maps (OSM) \citep{haklay:2008}, which  is a collaborative mapping project
to create a free  and editable map of the world. Since  OSM allows returning GPS
coordinates of each vertex, we use this information to create the street blocks,
and their corresponding directed cycles in clockwise orientation.

The set  of instances  contains 39  scenarios based on  notified cases  from the
cities of  Alto Santo and  Limoeiro do  Norte, in the  state of Ceará  - Brazil.
These notifications  were obtained  from the  Information System  for Notifiable
Diseases (SINAN) \citep{laguardia:2004}, from  the years of 2015-2021, including
information about the  addresses of the patients. The addresses  were applied in
the library OSMnx \citep{boeing:2017} in  order to obtain geocodes (latitude and
longitude), and map them to blocks as the number of cases in the arcs (streets).
The OSMnx receives  as input a radius size  to create the graph from  a map. The
arcs are the streets of the map and  the vertices are the intersection of two or
more streets,  as shown  in Figure \ref{fig:graph-examples}.  Each block  of the
graph  is  defined  as a  polygon,  and  an  algorithm  verifies if  the  Dengue
notification collocation belongs to any polygon (block).

Table \ref{tab:real-instances} contains the instances  of the generated set. The
first  column is  the  instance identification,  each  containing the  following
information: name of the city, size of  the map, and year of the notified cases,
respectively. The second to fourth columns are the number of vertices, arcs, and
blocks. Column  ``Notified Cases'' present the  total number of cases  mapped in
the graph. Lastly,  the column ``Blocks with Cases'' contains  the proportion of
street blocks that have notified Dengue cases.

\section{Computational Results} \label{sec:computational-results}

The model  was implemented  in C++,  compiled with GCC  version 7.5.0  using the
optimization level -O3. The experiments were  carried out on an Intel(R) Xeon(R)
CPU E5-2630  v4 processor with 10  cores of 2.20 GHz  each and 64Gb of  RAM. The
execution occurred on a 64-bit Ubuntu 18.04 Linux operating system. The full set
of instances and  experimental results obtained in this work  can be accessed at
\href{https://github.com/cvaraujo/instances-dengue-ARP}{https://github.com/cvaraujo/instances-dengue-ARP}.

The  \gls{dparp}  \gls{ilp}  formulation  was implemented  using  Gurobi  solver
version 9.5.1, maintaining  the default settings of its  parameters. The maximum
solution  time for  each  instance  was limited  to  3600  seconds. The  vehicle
velocity when the nebulizer is activated is $250$ meters$/$minute (approximately
$15km/h$)  and  $21km/h$  while  deactivated.  The maximum  time  of  the  route
($T_{max}$) is  limited by 120 minutes  since this value represents  the optimal
interval time  to apply insecticide in  the morning or afternoon.  The amount of
available insecticide was 4000$ml$, using $75ml$ per meter sprayed.

Table~\ref{tab:model-results} exhibits  the results of the  \gls{ilp} model. The
first  column is  the  instance identification,  each  containing the  following
information: Name of the city, size of  the map, and year of the notified cases,
respectively. The second to fourth columns are the number of vertices, arcs, and
blocks, respectively. Columns ``LB'' and ``UB'' present the ``Lower Bound (LB)''
(dual) and ``Upper  Bound (UB)'' (primal) for each instance.  The ``gap $(\%)$''
column  displays  the relative  gap  between  lower  and upper  bounds.  Columns
``Nodes'' indicates  the number of  Gurobi nodes.  The last column  displays the
time in  seconds needed to  solve the model. The  acronym TLE stands  for ``time
limit exceeded'', meaning  that the solver was interrupted  without reaching the
optimum. The lines highlighted in dark gray (\crule[gr]{3mm}{3mm}) represent the
instances in which the optimality was proved. The rows highlighted in light gray
(\crule[lgr]{3mm}{3mm}) correspond to the instances in which a feasible solution
was found, but the duality gap could not be closed.

\caption{Results of the formulation for real instances.}
\label{tab:model-results}
\end{table}

In Table \ref{tab:model-results}, it is noticed that the \gls{ilp} model reached
the optimum  for 31 instances,  being all  the 18 from  the city of  Alto Santo,
which contains  at most  353 vertices  and 946  arcs. From  the 21  instances of
Limoeiro, the optimal solution was reached for 13, some containing 1212 vertices
and 3497 arcs. The average time for  the 31 instances in which the optimal value
was  obtained was  $128.4$, and  the number  of Gurobi  nodes is  low, being  on
average $22.356$, and for 24 instances less than $750$ nodes.

For the other 8  instances in which the model did not  close the optimality gap,
the distance of  the bounds was less  than $1\%$ in two cases,  less than $18\%$
for  the other  2, and  obtaining higher  gaps for  only four  instances of  the
benchmark.  Since the  sub-tour  elimination constraints  were  applied as  lazy
constraints, it  was expected  that the  model would generate  a high  number of
Gurobi nodes in the branch-and-bound tree.

Considering the fact that we solving  real-world instances added to the increase
in the number of  vertices and arcs, there is an increase in  the time needed to
compute the optimal solution. It is also  difficult for the model to improve the
lower bound, and consequently close the gap, on four of the largest instances. A
factor that could contribute to this  difficulty is the distribution of notified
Dengue cases in the street blocks of the instance.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}

This  work  proposed, formulated,  and  provided  an  \gls{ilp} for  the  Dengue
Prize-collecting  Arc Routing  Problem (\gls{dparp}),  which is  the problem  of
generating routes for the spraying vehicles. The experiments were conducted on a
benchmark of instances based on the cities of Alto Santo and Limoeiro, and using
real  notification cases  from  the  years 2015-2021.  The  \gls{ilp} model  was
capable  of generating  lower and  upper bounds  for all  instances of  the set,
attaining 31  optimal solutions. The  proposed methodology has a  high potential
for reducing  routing costs and  contributes to  a more efficient  allocation of
resources  concerning the  control of  arboviral diseases,  which is  especially
relevant in municipalities with constrained budgets.

In future works, it is possible to develop new cut constraints aiming to improve
the  model, and  develop new  exact and  heuristic methodologies.  Moreover, the
model  could be  tested  with  real data  from  other  cities. Another  relevant
research is  to consider  variants of  the \gls{dparp},  considering a  fleet of
vehicles, multiple turns  to apply the insecticide,  and uncertainty parameters,
such  as the  efficiency  of  the insecticide  when  applied  in different  time
windows.
